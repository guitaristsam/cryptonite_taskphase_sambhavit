# Your First Shell Script
`
First created a file `x.sh` using `touch`. Then edited it using `nano x.sh` and put `/challenge/pwn
/challenge/college`inside then used `bash x.sh` to run it giving the flag `pwn.college{YauFQM8-sehzbcIehchZwdnVPbQ.dFzN4QDL4gjN0czW}`

```bash
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ touch x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ nano x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{YauFQM8-sehzbcIehchZwdnVPbQ.dFzN4QDL4gjN0czW}
```
Inside `nano x.sh`
```
/challenge/pwn
/challenge/college
```
