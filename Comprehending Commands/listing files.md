# listing files

Here, I used the `ls` command to list the files in the `/challenge` directory, then found the renamed executable `14422-renamed-run-20600` and ran it to reveal the flag.

```bash
@hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ ls /challenge
14422-renamed-run-20600  DESCRIPTION.md
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ /challenge/14422-renamed-run-20600
Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4N2dFXXu-_XpwduzRrgSqusi8nm.dhjM4QDL4gjN0czW}
```
