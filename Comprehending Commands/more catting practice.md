# more catting practice

Here I wasn't allowed the use the change directory/`cd` command so instead I found the flag using the absolute path which was `/usr/share/xml/flag`

```bash
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /usr/share/xml/flag
pwn.college{QlfRsVVN3mmumltuNsngFFqm5lM.dBjM5QDL4gjN0czW}
```
