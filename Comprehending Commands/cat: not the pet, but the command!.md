# cat: not the pet, but the command!

Here I used the `cat` or concatenate command to read out the file `flag`, which has the flag copied onto it. So `cat flag` reads the flag file which has the flag

```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{gKXBRp0ucX_CXPK7NuA3OX3zXyj.dFzN1QDL4gjN0czW}
```
