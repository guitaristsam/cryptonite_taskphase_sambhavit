# making directories

First navigated to the `tmp` directory using `cd` command then used the `mkdir` command to make a directory with the name `pwn` then went to that directory using `cd` command.
Then used `touch` command to make a file with the name `college`, then I used `/challenge/run` to get the flag `pwn.college{UwFWVa9GBiuEvOBA76bcCoWy4J8.dFzM4QDL4gjN0czW}`

```bash
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ mkdir pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp$ cd /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UwFWVa9GBiuEvOBA76bcCoWy4J8.dFzM4QDL4gjN0czW}
```
