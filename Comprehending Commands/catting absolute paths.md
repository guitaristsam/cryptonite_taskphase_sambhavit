# catting absolute paths

Here I used the `cat` or concatenate command to read out the file `flag`, which has the flag copied onto it. However this time I used the absolute path `/flag` as an argument instead.

```bash
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{wzToVW2w5jjxVhr_ID59X0GconE.dlTM5QDL4gjN0czW}
```
