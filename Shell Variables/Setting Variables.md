# Setting Variables

Here I used `=` to give the value `COLLEGE` to the variable `PWN`. I also learned that there cannot be a space between `PWN` and `=` otherwise it will try to run the `PWN` command like a command.
Using `PWN=COLLEGE` I got the flag `pwn.college{cPb5-6cfB8m0UDxCq3-JNeqz3GH.dlTN1QDL4gjN0czW}`

```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{cPb5-6cfB8m0UDxCq3-JNeqz3GH.dlTN1QDL4gjN0czW}
```
