# Reading Input

Here I learnt that I can read the input of the user using the `read` command. Here I need to set the `PWN` variable to the value `COLLEGE`. Which is why I did
`read PWN`and then `COLLEGE` which gave me the flag `pwn.college{Mo8HZB9tJ1d4tW06aZqzkwFEJ2C.dhzN1QDL4gjN0czW}`

```bash
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read PWN
COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Mo8HZB9tJ1d4tW06aZqzkwFEJ2C.dhzN1QDL4gjN0czW}
```
