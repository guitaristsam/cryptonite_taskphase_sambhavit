# Permissions Setting Practice

I used `=` this time in order to add permission bits overwriting the old ones. Here I just used this logic in order to set proper permissions through round 0-8.
Then I used `ls -l /flag` to check the permssions of the file `/flag` once I got to know it I used `chmod u=r /flag` in order to make the file readable to the owner(i.e me), using which I got the flag `pwn.college{4sJvsGqVz8tmbAmWBuZv3faY82W.dNTM5QDL4gjN0czW}`

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ ls -l /flag
