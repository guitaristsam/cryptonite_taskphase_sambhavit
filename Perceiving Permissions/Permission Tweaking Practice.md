# Permission Tweaking Practice

Round 0 : used `chmod g+x /challenge/pwn` because I saw that `x` was required in groups.
Round 1 : used `chmod a+x,o+w /challenge/pwn` because I saw that all(owner,group and others) required `x` and others required `w`.
Round 2 : used `chmod a-r /challenge/pwn` because I saw that all(owner,group and others) needed `r` removed.
Round 3 : used `chmod o+r /challenge/pwn` because I saw that others required `r`.
Round 4 : used `chmod u-w /challenge/pwn` because I saw owner need `w` removed.
Round 5 : used `chmod u-x,g-x /challenge/pwn` because I saw that owner need `x` removed and group needed `x` removed.
Round 6 : used `chmod g+x /challenge/pwn` because I saw that group need `x` added.
Round 7 : used `chmod a-x,o-w /challenge/pwn` because I saw that all(owner,group and others) needed `x` removed and others needed `w` removed.
Then I used `chmod a+rwx /flag` to give all(owner,group and others) permission for read,write and execute.
Then to find flag I used the `cat` command with `/flag` which gave me the flag `pwn.college{cBFhzp2fnDfv_ENpU3yHsvhORJJ.dBTM2QDL4gjN0czW}`

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod a+rwx /flag
