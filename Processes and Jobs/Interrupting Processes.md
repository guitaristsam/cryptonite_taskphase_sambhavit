# Interrupting Processes

Here I learnt that you can use `Ctrl+C` to kill a ongoing process.
Here I first ran `/challenge/run` then interruped it with `Ctrl+C` to get the flag `pwn.college{4F1LFe6LnY4vgLlw-fXlmCl4XD0.dNDN4QDL4gjN0czW}`

```bash
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4F1LFe6LnY4vgLlw-fXlmCl4XD0.dNDN4QDL4gjN0czW}
```
