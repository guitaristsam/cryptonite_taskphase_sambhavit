# Program and absolute Paths

To find the flag, I went to the challenge directory and in the challenge directory was run. So, I executed the run file, which gave me the flag

```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ApCXhku3AJS94R210e25AYBxAwn.dVDN1QDL4gjN0czW}
```
